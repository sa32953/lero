This index is passed to the **show_img** function to produce a grayscale image. The function works as follows: First it extract the whole row with the specified index from the X matrix. This need to be put in original shape to display correctly. Lets call this process as 'unflattening'. Here the row vector is reshaped to its original shape 20 by 20. This is done by Numpy **reshape** command. Here we use the Fortran indexing order to stack the row elements as per correct order. (Otherwise you see an incorrect image). Further, out input vector is in form of floating point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. For plotting Grayscale Image these need to be scaled to a factor of 0 to 255. \n",
